Gimp 3.0.2 has a bug with grid filters.
After export to a .png the grid show an offset compared to the .xcf.

A workaround is:
    - place the area to be filtered at a position that corresponds to the grid
    - the LED background gets a 8x8 and a vertical 128 grid -> upper left is (128, 8)
    - apply the grids
    - copy layer
    - merge down all filters in that layer
    - deactivatite the original one
